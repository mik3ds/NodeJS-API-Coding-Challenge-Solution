# NodeJS API Coding Challenge Solution
My successful solution to a programming challenge given in November 2018 by Kogan Melbourne.

Task: Write a script in any language that queries an API that returns objects with metadata. Extract the next URL in the sequence and query it. Store the prices of all objects with the correct name and return the average price upon completion.
